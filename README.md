# Awesome Endo Adeno Resources Overview

![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)

*Welcome to your go-to resource for navigating the challenges of Endometriosis and Adenomyosis*. Diagnosis, symptom management, and treatment can be really overwhelming, but it shouldn't be.

- *Endometriosis*: A chronic condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, causing pain, heavy periods, and infertility. It affects approximately 190 million people worldwide.
- *Adenomyosis*: A condition where endometrial tissue grows into the muscular wall of the uterus, leading to heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, and uterine enlargement. It often resolves after menopause.

## Diagnosis

- Endometriosis
  - Current Methods:
    - Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis.
    - Imaging techniques like MRI and ultrasound are used but may miss early or atypical cases.
    - New non-invasive blood tests (e.g., [Ziwig Endo Test](https://ziwig.com/en/ziwig-endotest/); [PromarkerEndo](https://www.proteomics.com.au/wp-content/uploads/PromarkerEndo-Brochure-Nov-2024.pdf)) have shown promise in detecting biomarkers associated with the disease.
  - Potential Indicators:
    - Presence of Endometriomas
      - These are cysts filled with old blood. Endometriomas are a type of Endometriosis, but alternatively, Endometriosis does not mean that you have an Endometrioma.
- Adenomyosis
  - Current Methods:
    - Diagnosis is often based on symptoms, pelvic exams, and imaging (MRI or ultrasound).
    - Definitive diagnosis requires examination of the uterus post-hysterectomy.
  - Potential Inidcators:
    - Decidual Casts
    - Excessive Bleeding during periods

### Medicinal

#### As stated from [EndoWhat?](https://www.youtube.com/c/endowhat), "All medications aimed at "treating" endometriosis only manage symptoms. They do not treat the disease itself. Drug therapy can suppress endometriosis, not eradicate it."

#### Medication and Medicinal Supplements

- [Immunology and Immunotherapy of Endometriosis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8708975/)
  - Research on the treatment of Endometriosis symptoms with Low Dose Naltrexone

#### Cannabis and Herbal

  - "Lara Parker shares her personal experience with endometriosis and discusses various non-surgical treatment options."
- [Cannabis and Endometriosis: A Survey of Its Effectiveness](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258940)
  - "This study explores the effectiveness of cannabis in managing endometriosis symptoms, providing valuable insights into its potential benefits."
- [Cannabinoids Improve Symptoms in Mice with Endometriosis](https://elifesciences.org/for-the-press/84e17c36/cannabinoids-improve-symptoms-in-mice-with-endometriosis)
  - "This research highlights the potential of cannabinoids in alleviating endometriosis symptoms in a mouse model."

#### Physical Therapy

- [Pelvic Health Physiotherapy: A Guide for People With Endometriosis](https://endometriosisnetwork.com/endo-hub/pelvic-health-physiotherapy-a-guide-for-people-with-endometriosis/)
  - Pelvic health physiotherapy is an effective, evidence‑based treatment for some symptoms of endometriosis, like pain with sexual activity. It's also helpful for treating other conditions and diseases that many people with endometriosis have, either independently or as a result of endometriosis.

### Research Foundation
**Groundbreaking Study:** [Comorbidity analysis and clustering of endometriosis patients using electronic health records](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379125003180) (Khan et al., 2025) analyzed >43,500 endometriosis patients across six UC medical centers, identifying **over 600 disease correlations** and confirming endometriosis as a **multi-system disorder** affecting multiple body systems beyond gynecology.

### Clinical Implications

#### Multi-System Disease Recognition
- **Paradigm shift:** Endometriosis should be approached as a **systemic disorder** rather than isolated gynecological condition
- **Multi-specialty care:** Recognition necessitates coordinated care across medical specialties
- **Enhanced surveillance:** Increased monitoring for associated conditions in affected systems

#### Personalized Treatment Approaches
- **Patient clustering:** Distinct subgroups with different comorbidity patterns require tailored treatments
- **Comorbidity management:** Integrated care addressing all affected body systems
- **Therapeutic opportunities:** Shared pathways with comorbid conditions offer new treatment avenues

#### Novel Therapeutic Avenues
- **Statin therapy:** Based on protective lipid associations (OR = 0.67)
- **Migraine medications:** Shared pathway treatments for neurological symptoms
- **Multi-target approaches:** Addressing systemic inflammation across affected systems

  - Conducting a Phase 2a clinical trial of TU2670 in endometriosis in 5 European countries. TU2670 is an oral GnRH antagonist that can bind to pituitary receptors to suppress estradiol hormone.

### Potential Causes

- [Fusobacterium Infection](https://sydneyendometriosis.com.au/blog/endometriosis-research-breakthroughs-what-you-need-to-know/)
  - Researchers in Japan have identified a particular kind of bacteria in those with endometriosis by examining the microbes inhabiting the endometrium. Of 155 patients with endometriosis, 64% had a Fusobacterium infection. Only 7% of patients without endometriosis carried the bacteria. Further research showed that by introducing the infection to mice to replicate the disease, the infection can be treated with cheap and widely available antibiotics. With evidence that Fusobacterium may contribute to the growth of endometriosis, further research will be conducted in humans on the potential of antibiotics as a treatment.
