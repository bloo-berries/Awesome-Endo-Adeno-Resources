# Overview

![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)

Welcome to your go-to resource for navigating the challenges of Endometriosis and Adenomyosis. Diagnosis, symptom management, and treatment can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be.

- **Endometriosis:** A chronic condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, causing pain, heavy periods, and infertility. It affects approximately 190 million people worldwide.
- **Adenomyosis:** A condition where endometrial tissue grows into the muscular wall of the uterus, leading to heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, and uterine enlargement. It often resolves after menopause.

## Diagnosis

### Endometriosis

- **Current Methods:**
  - Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis.
  - Imaging techniques like MRI and ultrasound are used but may miss early or atypical cases.
  - New non-invasive blood tests (e.g., [Ziwig Endo Test](https://ziwig.com/en/ziwig-endotest/), [PromarkerEndo](https://www.proteomics.com.au/wp-content/uploads/PromarkerEndo-Brochure-Nov-2024.pdf)) are emerging.
- **Potential Indicators:**
  - Presence of Endometriomas (cysts filled with old blood).

### Adenomyosis

- **Current Methods:**
  - Diagnosis is often based on symptoms, pelvic exams, and imaging (MRI or ultrasound).
  - Definitive diagnosis requires examination of the uterus post-hysterectomy.
- **Potential Indicators:**
  - Decidual Casts
  - Excessive Bleeding during periods

## Therapeutic Treatments

### Surgical

#### Endometriosis Treatments

- **Hysterectomy does NOT treat Endometriosis, only Adenomyosis.**
- **Laparoscopic Excision Surgery:** Gold standard for endometriosis.
- **Presacral Neurectomy:** Relieves severe pelvic pain.
- **Lysis of Adhesions:** Removes scar tissue.
- **Resection of Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis (DIE):** Removes deep lesions.
- **Robotic-Assisted Surgery:** For complex cases.

#### Adenomyosis Treatments

- **Hysterectomy:** For severe adenomyosis.
- **Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE):** Minimally invasive, high success rate ([source](https://blog.nbir.com.au/alternative-to-hysterectomy-for-adenoymosis)).
- **Radiofrequency Ablation:** Pain reduction and fertility preservation.
- **High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU):** Non-surgical ([source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/)).
- **Myomectomy:** Removes fibroids, preserves fertility.
