# Overview of Conditions
- Endometriosis: A chronic condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, causing pain, heavy periods, and infertility. It affects approximately 190 million women worldwide.
- Adenomyosis: A condition where endometrial tissue grows into the muscular wall of the uterus, leading to heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, and uterine enlargement. It often resolves after menopause.

## Diagnosis
- Endometriosis
  - Current Methods:
    - Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis4.
    - Imaging techniques like MRI and ultrasound are used but may miss early or atypical cases34.
    - New non-invasive blood tests (e.g., PromarkerEndo) have shown promise in detecting protein biomarkers associated with the disease8.
- Adenomyosis
  - Current Methods:
    - Diagnosis is often based on symptoms, pelvic exams, and imaging (MRI or ultrasound)57.
    - Definitive diagnosis requires examination of the uterus post-hysterectomy5.
