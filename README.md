# Overview

Welcome to your go-to resource for navigating the challenges of Endometriosis and Adenomyosis. Diagnosis, symptom management, and treatment can be really overwhelming, but it shouldn't be.

- Endometriosis: A chronic condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, causing pain, heavy periods, and infertility. It affects approximately 190 million women worldwide.
- Adenomyosis: A condition where endometrial tissue grows into the muscular wall of the uterus, leading to heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, and uterine enlargement. It often resolves after menopause.

## Diagnosis
- Endometriosis
  - Current Methods:
    - Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis.
    - Imaging techniques like MRI and ultrasound are used but may miss early or atypical cases.
    - New non-invasive blood tests (e.g., [Ziwig Endo Test](https://ziwig.com/en/ziwig-endotest/); [PromarkerEndo](https://www.proteomics.com.au/wp-content/uploads/PromarkerEndo-Brochure-Nov-2024.pdf)) have shown promise in detecting biomarkers associated with the disease.
- Adenomyosis
  - Current Methods:
    - Diagnosis is often based on symptoms, pelvic exams, and imaging (MRI or ultrasound).
    - Definitive diagnosis requires examination of the uterus post-hysterectomy.

## Therapeutic Treatments

### Surgical

#### Endometriosis Treatments
  * It is critical to note: Hysterecomy DOES NOT treat Endometriosis, only Adenomyosis

- **Laparoscopic Excision Surgery**
  - "Laparoscopic excision surgery is considered the gold standard for the treatment of endometriosis, involving the removal of endometriotic lesions while preserving healthy tissue."
- **Presacral Neurectomy**
  - "Presacral neurectomy involves cutting the nerves to the uterus to relieve severe pelvic pain associated with endometriosis."
- **Lysis of Adhesions**
  - "This surgical procedure aims to remove scar tissue (adhesions) that can form as a result of endometriosis and cause pain and infertility."
- **Resection of Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis (DIE)**
  - "This surgical procedure targets the removal of deeply infiltrating endometriotic lesions that can affect organs such as the bowel, bladder, and ureters."
- **Robotic-Assisted Surgery**
  - "Robotic-assisted surgery offers enhanced precision and control for the removal of endometriotic lesions and is an option for complex cases."

#### Adenomyosis Treatments

- **Hysterectomy**
  - "A hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus, may be recommended for severe cases of adenomyosis that do not respond to other treatments."
- **Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE)**
  - "UAE is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat adenomyosis by blocking the blood supply to the affected areas, leading to a reduction in symptoms."
- **Myomectomy**
  - "Myomectomy involves the surgical removal of fibroids from the uterus and can be an option for women with adenomyosis who wish to preserve their fertility."

### Non-Surgical

#### Supplements; Therapies; Etc
- As stated from [EndoWhat?](https://endowhat.com/educate/), "All medications aimed at “treating” endometriosis only manage symptoms. They do not treat the disease itself. Drug therapy can suppress endometriosis, not eradicate it."

<details>
<summary>Potential Causes</summary>

  - [Fusobacterium Infection](https://sydneyendometriosis.com.au/blog/endometriosis-research-breakthroughs-what-you-need-to-know/)
    - Researchers in Japan have identified a particular kind of bacteria in women with endometriosis by examining the microbes inhabiting the endometrium. Of 155 patients with endometriosis, 64% had a Fusobacterium infection. Only 7% of patients without endometriosis carried the bacteria. Further research showed that by introducing the infection to mice to replicate the disease, the infection can be treated with cheap and widely available antibiotics. With evidence that Fusobacterium may contribute to the growth of endometriosis, further research will be conducted in humans on the potential of antibiotics as a treatment.
