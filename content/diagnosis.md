# Diagnosis Resources

Getting an accurate diagnosis for endometriosis and adenomyosis can be challenging. This page provides comprehensive information about diagnostic methods, tools, and what to expect during the diagnostic process.

## Diagnostic Overview

### Why Diagnosis is Important
- Early diagnosis can prevent disease progression
- Proper diagnosis guides treatment decisions
- Understanding your condition helps with symptom management
- Diagnosis is often required for insurance coverage of treatments

### Common Challenges
- Symptoms can be similar to other conditions
- Many healthcare providers lack specialized knowledge

- Some diagnostic methods are invasive

## Diagnostic Methods

### For Endometriosis

#### Laparoscopy (Gold Standard)
- **What it is**: Minimally invasive surgical procedure
- **How it works**: Small incisions allow direct visualization of pelvic organs
- **Advantages**: Definitive diagnosis, can treat during same procedure
- **Considerations**: Requires general anesthesia, surgical risks

#### Imaging Techniques
- **MRI**: Can detect deep infiltrating endometriosis
- **Ultrasound**: May show endometriomas and some lesions
- **Limitations**: May miss early or superficial lesions

#### Blood Tests (Emerging)
- **[Ziwig Endo Test](https://ziwig.com/en/ziwig-endotest/)**: Saliva-based test for endometriosis biomarkers
- **[PromarkerEndo](https://www.proteomics.com.au/wp-content/uploads/PromarkerEndo-Brochure-Nov-2024.pdf)**: Blood test for endometriosis markers
- **Status**: Promising but not yet widely available

### For Adenomyosis

#### Imaging (Primary Method)
- **MRI**: Most accurate imaging method
- **Transvaginal Ultrasound**: Can detect uterine wall thickening
- **Advantages**: Non-invasive, widely available

#### Clinical Assessment
- **Pelvic Exam**: May reveal enlarged, tender uterus
- **Symptom History**: Heavy bleeding, chronic pain
- **Definitive Diagnosis**: Requires hysterectomy and tissue examination
