Welcome to your go-to resource for navigating the challenges of Endometriosis and Adenomyosis. Diagnosis, symptom management, and treatment can be really overwhelming, but it shouldn't be.

- **Endometriosis**: A chronic condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, causing pain, heavy periods, and infertility. It affects approximately 190 million people worldwide.
- **Adenomyosis**: A condition where endometrial tissue grows into the muscular wall of the uterus, leading to heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, and uterine enlargement. It often resolves after menopause.

This resource list is packed with expert advice, community support, and the latest medical research insights, all aimed at making your life a little easier. Whether you're newly diagnosed or have been living with these conditions for a while, my hope is to offer guidance and support.

Dive in to discover practical tips, connect with others who understand what we're going through, and explore treatment options that could make a real difference in your life.

## Diagnosis

### Endometriosis
- **Current Methods**:
  - Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis.
  - Imaging techniques like MRI and ultrasound are used but may miss early or atypical cases.
  - New non-invasive blood tests (e.g., [Ziwig Endo Test](https://ziwig.com/en/ziwig-endotest/); [PromarkerEndo](https://www.proteomics.com.au/wp-content/uploads/PromarkerEndo-Brochure-Nov-2024.pdf)) have shown promise in detecting biomarkers associated with the disease.
- **Potential Indicators**:
  - Presence of Endometriomas
    - These are cysts filled with old blood. Endometriomas are a type of Endometriosis, but alternatively, Endometriosis does not mean that you have an Endometrioma.

### Adenomyosis
- **Current Methods**:
  - Diagnosis is often based on symptoms, pelvic exams, and imaging (MRI or ultrasound).
  - Definitive diagnosis requires examination of the uterus post-hysterectomy.
- **Potential Indicators**:
  - Decidual Casts
  - Excessive Bleeding during periods

### Endometriosis Symptoms

| Stage/Type | Severity | Symptoms | Metastasis |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stage I (Minimal)** | Mild | Mild or no pelvic pain; Possible infertility; Occasional dysmenorrhea | None |
| **Stage II (Mild)** | Mild to moderate | Moderate pelvic pain; Dysmenorrhea; Dyspareunia; Possible infertility | None |
| **Stage III (Moderate)** | Moderate | Chronic pelvic pain; Severe dysmenorrhea; Dyspareunia; Dyschezia; Infertility | Local spread |
| **Stage IV (Severe)** | Severe | Chronic, severe pelvic pain; Debilitating dysmenorrhea; Severe dyspareunia; Dyschezia; Dysuria; Infertility; Bowel/bladder dysfunction | Extensive local spread |
| **Stage IV+ (Very Severe)** | Very severe | All Stage IV symptoms, plus: Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis (DIE): Intense chronic pelvic pain; Severe dyspareunia; Dyschezia, bowel obstruction possible; Dysuria, hydronephrosis possible; Organ dysfunction depending on affected areas (e.g., bowel, bladder). Thoracic Endometriosis: Catamenial pneumothorax (lung collapse during menstruation); Hemoptysis (coughing up blood); Cyclic chest pain, shoulder pain, or dyspnea (shortness of breath); Hemothorax or pericardial effusion in severe cases | Extensive spread to deep tissues or distant sites such as the chest cavity |

*Staging is not utilized universally, nor does staging denote the severity of pain and/or symptoms*

### Adenomyosis Symptoms

| Type/Stage | Severity | Symptoms | Metastasis |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Focal Adenomyosis** | Mild to severe | Localized uterine pain or tenderness; Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia); Dysmenorrhea (painful periods); Dyspareunia (painful intercourse); Pelvic pressure or fullness; Possible infertility | Localized uterine involvement |
| **Diffuse Adenomyosis** | Moderate to severe | Diffuse uterine pain or tenderness; Severe menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding); Chronic pelvic pain; Dyspareunia; Significant uterine enlargement ("boggy" uterus); Anemia due to heavy bleeding; Infertility or miscarriage risk | Extensive uterine involvement |
| **Stage 1: Early** | Mild | Minimal infiltration of endometrial tissue into the uterine wall; Symptoms often mild or non-existent | None |
| **Stage 2: Moderate** | Moderate | Increased infiltration of uterine wall tissue; Heavy and painful periods; Bloating and discomfort during intercourse | None |
| **Stage 3: Severe** | Severe | Severe infiltration leading to distortion of uterine shape; Escalating menstrual pain and flow intensity | Possible localized spread |
| **Stage 4: Advanced** | Very severe | Extensive tissue infiltration causing significant uterine damage; Chronic pelvic pain, heavy bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding, and painful intercourse | Potential damage to surrounding structures |
