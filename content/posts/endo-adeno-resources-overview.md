Diagnosis, symptom management, and treatment can be really overwhelming, but it shouldn't be.

- [*Endometriosis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis): A chronic condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, causing pain, heavy periods, and infertility. It affects approximately 190 million people worldwide.
- [*Adenomyosis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenomyosis): A condition where endometrial tissue grows into the muscular wall of the uterus, leading to heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, and uterine enlargement. It often resolves after menopause.

## Diagnosis

- [Endometriosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis)
  - Current Methods:
    - Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis.
    - Imaging techniques like MRI and ultrasound are used but may miss early or atypical cases.
    - New non-invasive blood tests (e.g., [Ziwig Endo Test](https://ziwig.com/en/ziwig-endotest/); [PromarkerEndo](https://www.proteomics.com.au/wp-content/uploads/PromarkerEndo-Brochure-Nov-2024.pdf)) have shown promise in detecting biomarkers associated with the disease.
  - Potential Indicators:
    - Presence of [Endometriomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrioma)
      - These are cysts filled with old blood. Endometriomas are a type of Endometriosis, but alternatively, Endometriosis does not mean that you have an Endometrioma.
- [Adenomyosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenomyosis)
  - Current Methods:
    - Diagnosis is often based on symptoms, pelvic exams, and imaging (MRI or ultrasound).
    - Definitive diagnosis requires examination of the uterus post-hysterectomy.
  - Potential Inidcators:
    - [Decidual Casts](https://ispub.com/IJGO/9/1/11420)
    - Excessive Bleeding during periods

### [Endometriosis Symptoms](https://www.ivf.com.au/blog/heres-the-four-stages-of-endometriosis)

|---|---|---|---|
|**Stage I (Minimal)**|Mild|Mild or no pelvic pain; Possible infertility; Occasional dysmenorrhea|None|
|**Stage II (Mild)**|Mild to moderate|Moderate pelvic pain; Dysmenorrhea; Dyspareunia; Possible infertility|None|
|**Stage III (Moderate)**|Moderate|Chronic pelvic pain; Severe dysmenorrhea; Dyspareunia; Dyschezia; Infertility|Local spread|

Thoracic Endometriosis: Catamenial pneumothorax (lung collapse during menstruation); Hemoptysis (coughing up blood); Cyclic chest pain, shoulder pain, or dyspnea (shortness of breath); Hemothorax or pericardial effusion in severe cases|Extensive spread to deep tissues or distant sites such as the chest cavity|

*Staging is not utilized universally, nor does staging denote the severity of pain and/or symptoms

  - **Population:** >43,500 endometriosis patients across six UC medical centers
  - **Key Findings:**
    - **661 significantly enriched conditions** identified at UCSF
    - **302 conditions replicated** across independent datasets (45% validation rate)
    - **Strongest associations:** Uterine adenomyosis (OR = 181), pelvic adhesions (OR = 51.1)
    - **Protective effects:** Hyperlipidemia (OR = 0.67) - potential statin therapy benefits
    - **Patient clustering:** Distinct subgroups with different comorbidity patterns
  - **Clinical Impact:** Confirms endometriosis as multi-system disorder requiring personalized treatment approaches
  - **Data Source:** De-identified EHRs using OMOP Common Data Model with cross-dataset validation

- [Fusobacterium Infection](https://sydneyendometriosis.com.au/blog/endometriosis-research-breakthroughs-what-you-need-to-know/)
  - Researchers in Japan have identified a particular kind of bacteria in those with endometriosis by examining the microbes inhabiting the endometrium. Of 155 patients with endometriosis, 64% had a Fusobacterium infection. Only 7% of patients without endometriosis carried the bacteria. Further research showed that by introducing the infection to mice to replicate the disease, the infection can be treated with cheap and widely available antibiotics. With evidence that Fusobacterium may contribute to the growth of endometriosis, further research will be conducted in humans on the potential of antibiotics as a treatment.
